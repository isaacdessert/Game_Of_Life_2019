/*
 * Game of Life
 * 
 * A version of John Conway's classic Game of Life, written in C.
 * CIS 343 - Winter 2019
 * 
 * Author:  Ira Woodring
 *
 * This program saves and loads games using the following format:
 * The first byte of the file is the height.
 * The second byte of the file is the width.
 * The remaining bytes of the file are either zeros or ones,
 * where a one is a live cell and a zero is no cell.
 * Unlike some versions we will not keep track of where a cell
 * was when it died; i.e. when a cell dies it is just gone.
 * If the height of the file is h and the width is w, the
 * total size of the file in bytes would then be (h x w) + 2.
